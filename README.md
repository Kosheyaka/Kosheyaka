- 👋 Hi, I'm @Kosheyaka (Dmitry Volkov)
- 👀 I'm interested in many things and usually open for unusual discussions
- 🌱 I'm trying to master JavaScript (and TypeScript), SQL databases and related tools
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on my [Tinkoff Investment client](https://github.com/Kosheyaka/tinkoff-client-backend): It would be great if someone made a frontend for this project.
