- 👋 Hi, I'm @Kosheyaka (Dmitry Volkov)
- 👀 I'm interested in being a good person
- 🌱 I'm currently learning NodeJS (mostly TypeScript) and related tools
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on my [Tinkoff Investment client](https://github.com/Kosheyaka/tinkoff-client-backend): it would be awesome, if somebody will make frontend part of this project.
